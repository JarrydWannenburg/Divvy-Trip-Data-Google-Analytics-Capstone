## Background
### Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. 

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

### Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 
1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Report
### Business task and stakeholder analysis 
The goal of this analysis is to understand how casual and annual riders use Cyclistic’s bikes differently by identifying trends and characteristics from historical data, so a new targeted marketing strategy can be developed centered on converting casual riders into annual members to maximize growth.

Knowing your customer is the first step to being able to market your product, so data on these groups is very valuable as insights can direct focus and highlight key areas that are fundamental to business decisions. In this example, an analysis of two customer groups could provide characteristics that Lily and her team can use in their marketing campaigns.

There are four primary stakeholders in this project:
1. _Lily Moreno_ - Director of Marketing: She is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels. Lily’s goal is to design targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members through the most effective digital channels
2. _Cyclistic executive team_: The executive team will determine whether or not to approve Lily’s marketing campaign. To facilitate their decision, they want key insights and high-quality visuals assessing the situation.
3. _Cyclistic marketing analytics team_: A team, which I am a part of, consisting of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
4. _Casual riders_ - Target customers: Casual riders are those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes. They may be recurring customers who have not committed to the annual pass, or they may be one-time riders (unable to answer this due to data privacy), therefore insights gathered from this group will need to be at an aggregate level. Converting casual riders into members is the core focus of this analysis since its believed that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) exists for these users.
5. _Cyclistic members_ - Group to maximize: Members are those who have purchased the annual pass and are believed to be the most profitable customers.
