# Divvy-Trip-Data-Google-Analytics-Capstone

## Note
Due to size restrictions on this free github account, the data used in this project can't be uploaded but can still be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) with its license [here](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

The draft version includes code that excludes all null values (naively) whereas the final version relaxes that and excludes only nulls found in the latitude and longitude fields of the data (about a 1.14M record difference).

## Contents
This repository contains:
- R file(s) used in the project
- Written report through the eyes of a data analyst working on this project assigned the question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
